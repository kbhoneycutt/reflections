When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    One could argue if you have anything you want to save, you should use a remote 
    repository, because hard drives crash, laptops get stolen, etc.
    
    But in particular, you should use a remote repository in these situations:
    1. You may be editing the same code from two or more different computers.
    2. You have others collaborating with you on the same code.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
